### CS61B Data Structure

This repository includes all class projects I did for CS61B Data Structure, a course offered by UC Berkeley's EECS Department. I finished most part of the course in July 2020, and then the rest in October 2020. The skeleton codes I used are from Berkeley's Spring 2019 semester. *This repository is temporarily made public for recruitment purpose.*
